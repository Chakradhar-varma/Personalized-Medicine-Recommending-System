# Personalized Medicine Recommending System

## Overview
The **Personalized Medicine Recommending System** is a machine learning-based solution designed to recommend personalized medication based on patient data. The system analyzes various health parameters and medical history to suggest optimal treatments tailored to individual needs.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares medical data for analysis.
- Machine Learning Model: Trains a model to predict the best medicine based on patient attributes.
- Personalized Recommendations: Suggests optimal medications for individuals.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook.
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
Other dependencies might include tensorflow or xgboost, depending on the model used.

## How to Use
**Load the Dataset:** Import patient medical records and preprocess them.
**Train the Model:** Run the training cell to develop a predictive model.
**Make Predictions:** Use the trained model to generate personalized medicine recommendations.
**Evaluate Performance:** Check model accuracy using validation data.

## File Structure
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook: Personalized_Medicine_Recommending_System.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset containing patient health records.
2. Preprocess the data using the provided functions.
3. Train the model using the given machine learning techniques.
4. Input new patient data and get personalized medicine recommendations.

## Dataset
The system requires a structured dataset with the following attributes:
- Patient demographics
- Medical history
- Symptoms and diagnoses
- Prescribed medications and outcomes

## Technologies Used
